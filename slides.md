Thank you everybody for coming, and thanks to all the organizers for such a wonderful event. I'm so grateful to be here again.

I'm Sage Abdullah, you can find me online @laymonage on GitHub, Fosstodon, and other places.

First of all, I was in two minds about doing this talk. I was afraid that this was going to be Sage talking about Sage on the stage and I couldn't gauge whether people would want to engage – but, I'll try.

I'm from Indonesia.

These days I work at Torchbox in the UK to maintain and develop Wagtail CMS, an open source content-management system built on top of Django.

Back in 2019 I did Google Summer of Code (or GSOC) with Django as a student, and this year, I was a mentor.

I think it's safe to say that we all know Django's tagline:

"The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines."

I don't know who came up with it, but it's catchy. I looked at the web archive and it's been there since the first snapshot in July 2005. I hope Frank is going to tell us about this in his talk on Wednesday.

Anyway, but to me, Django is the web framework

that changed my life.

And let me tell you why.

# How it started...

<v-switch>
  <template #0><img class="rounded-md h-xs mx-auto mb-4" src="/ppw-slides.png" /></template>
</v-switch>

A web design & programming course at university

<!--
So, I first learned Django during my second year of uni back in 2018 as part of the web programming course.

It used to be PHP, but the previous year they updated the curriculum to teach Python for the basics, so it makes sense to use Django for the web.

And yes, it's a screenshot of a slide within a slide.

    )
    user.save()

```

  </template>
</v-switch>

<!--
As part of the course we were tasked to build our own website.

Which started out simple, with just a model or two, some views and templates. And we added more features throughout the course. By the way, I spun up this six year old project which used Django 2.1 and it still worked.

Anyway, we were given new assignments every week. At one point we learned about making AJAX requests from the browser to Google Books API. You can search for books and add them to your favorites.

To store the "favorite books" data, I could technically just have a model with the book ID and use a ForeignKey to the user. But at the time, I thought having one model instance for each book you saved is a bit overkill, especially when the books data came from a third-party service – in this case Google.

So what did I do instead?

!!!

I used – or I guess abused – sessions. You can use it as a dictionary and even use lists as the values. Perfect! I'll just throw the list of IDs to the session. Done!

Well, almost. Using sessions would mean that the data will be lost when the user logs out. How can I keep the data then?

I looked it up, and saw that Django has a

!!!

JSONField that lets you store dictionaries and lists! But – it was only available for Postgres. We did use Postgres on Heroku for the deployed website, but we also used SQLite for local development. JSONField was not an option for me.

So, I was like. Okay, how hard is it to have my own JSONField? If I can transform the dictionary into a string, I can save it to a TextField. Then, I just need some way to parse the string back into a dictionary. And that's...

!!!

what I did! I just used Python's built-in JSON library to serialize and deserialize the data, then I can save it in a TextField.

That being said, I know that if I were to do this today, I would just use a dedicated model with ForeignKey to store the saved books – but hey, I was just a student back then.

<!--
I saw an opportunity.

This is the Google Summer of Code website back in 2019.

If you're not familiar with Google Summer of Code (GSoC), it's an annual global program held by Google, where university students can work with an open-source organization on a 3-month project in the summer. And, they get paid by Google!

Organizations like Django can list a few project ideas and apply to the program, and Google will give a number of project slots. Then, students can submit a proposal for the project they want to work on, to be reviewed and accepted by someone from the organization.

!!!

Django has participated in GSoC every year since 2016. And for each year, we put a list of project ideas on the wiki.

I already knew about GSoC at that point, and since I've learned a bit of Django, I was curious about Django's ideas for GSoC that year.

Notice how it says **in no particular order**. Well it just so happened that the first item on the list was:

**A cross-database JSONField!**

That was... _basically_ the **exact** thing I hacked together in my project.

**I was _hooked_.**

# Getting the feel of it

  <template #1>

<img v-click class="rounded-md h-sm mx-auto mb-4" src="/first-pr.png" />

  </template>

  <template #2>

<img class="rounded-md w-4xl mx-auto mb-4" src="/first-three-prs.png" />

  </template>
</v-switch>

<!--
The thing with GSoC is that if you wanted to get in, you have to realize there are other students like yourself. So, you need to convince the mentors that you are the right person for the job. You have to stand out among other applicants. It's just like job hunting.

So, before I started working on my proposal, I concocted a plan. I wanted to get at least one pull request (PR) to Django merged – but hopefully more than just one.

I started looking into the contribution guide, and I

!!!

watched the ticket tracker, waiting for a new ticket marked as "easy pickings" – which is kind of like a "good first issue" label on GitHub. They come and go so quickly.

!!!

Eventually I was able to land my first PR to Django – after some back and forth. As you can see there are 21 comments on the PR, for something that's essentially a one-line change, with three lines of test, and some documentation.

I learned a lot from this PR and it was a great experience. You get the general feeling and the common practices on how to make changes to the codebase.

This is important, since you need to demonstrate that you are willing to learn. You are able to follow the instructions, and you are **patient**. Which may sound trivial, but it is actually a big deal in open source. Speaking from experience, there are people who rush to get things done and want their PR merged, but they don't follow the instructions from the maintainers. That is not a good outlook.

!!!

Anyway, then I got two more PRs merged, one of which was for a ticket that I wrote myself. All of these are basically just one-liners, but they cover different aspects: implementation, tests, and documentation.

Now that I have three PRs, I got started with my proposal.

Mind you, at the time, I was still taking my databases course. So, I just started learning SQL and the basic stuff like foreign keys and joins and whatnot.

I only had vague ideas of how this project was going to work – and looking back at the proposal, I think it showed.

It's not a perfect proposal by any means, but I put it together in between my midterm exams, so I did what I could.

!!!

I posted it to the django-developers mailing list, got a few responses.

I made a few tweaks based on the feedback.

Then... I _waited_.

My proposal was accepted. It was like 4:30 in the morning, and I got chills from reading this email.

It was happening!!!

!!!

So, over the course of the summer, I worked on the project. I was slightly intimidated when I saw that I had not one, not two, but four people mentoring me. It felt like the expectation was quite high.

But thankfully, I didn't have to start from scratch.

I was standing on the shoulders of giants.

Obviously, we already had the Postgres JSONField at the time, which worked wonders. But we also had external packages that implemented JSONField for other database backends too.

- We had it in Django-MySQL !!!
- We had one for Oracle, and !!!
- We also had django-jsonfallback that combined the built-in Postgres and django-mysql's JSONFields before falling back to a TextField on others.

!!!

and many, many other packages... some of which even predated the built-in Postgres JSONField.

On June 9th 2019, which happened to be my 20th birthday, I submitted this initial PR to Django.

You can see how many people reviewed the PR. On the right side there.

!!!

I have blurred the number of comments on the PR. Would anybody like to take a guess on how many comments we have here?

Fifty? A hundred? Two hundred?

!!!

There were 321 comments. This was just the initial PR that I kept on iterating.

So at one point, we decided to close it and open a new one to start fresh.

This is the final PR, opened months later in January 2020. GSoC already ended in August. It wasn't merged until May 8th 2020, so when COVID really kicked in.

It was not officially launched yet, so it was a bit hush-hush. But sure, I joined it.

!!!

I saw this message from Thibaud (whom I didn't really know at the time), a job listing for a junior level developer at Torchbox, an agency in the UK. They were doing remote hiring, pretty much worldwide.

So I looked at their website, and then I found...

# A job listing

A job listing for a Wagtail Developer.

The job is to work on Wagtail the CMS. And doing open source as a full-time job was my dream.

I looked at the requirements, and I think I pretty much ticked all the boxes, so I sent my application.

Then I did a couple interviews and a coding task. I was interviewed by Tom Dyson, the CTO, and he knew about my JSONField stuff. A few days later, I got the job!

They wanted me to move to the UK as soon as possible, but it was such a surprise for me and my family. So I asked to work remotely for a few months while we sort out my visa and stuff.

# First thing on the job

<img alt="" v-click class="rounded-md h-sm mx-auto mb-4" src="/wagtailspace.png" />

<!--
And do you know what one of the first things I did on the job was?

Well, Wagtail had their own version of JSONField that used the TextField approach. Around that time, it happened that Wagtail was about to bump its minimum Django version to 3.2, which includes the new JSONField.

!!!

So naturally, I was tasked to migrate all these existing text-based "JSONField"s into real JSONFields.

Then I gave a talk about it at Wagtail Space US, which is Wagtail's own conference. But I did it virtually because I was still in Indonesia.

That was two years ago, and the rest – is history.

A lot of other things have happened since, but what I've shown you so far is enough to give you the idea.

But that's not to mention the effect of all this on the people around me as well. My family's financial situation pretty much had a complete turnaround. We were struggling to keep our feet up, and COVID made it even worse. But now it almost seems like it was just a bad dream. All thanks to Django.

It started with me learning Django, and the rest didn't happen overnight. It's a snowball that keeps on rolling, and I have been very lucky to have all these opportunities. It's a privilege.

And so, I'd like to thank the biggest factor that made it all possible.

This year, I mentored a project that adds support for updating JSONFields on the database level. It's like an SQL – sorry, a sequel – to my project. It has come full circle.

One of the most obvious is to make PRs to Django. Submit bug fixes, enhancements, documentation improvements. Sure, it is not the easiest thing – but it is very, very rewarding. Seeing that purple merge icon on GitHub, and your name on the contributors list. It's one of the best feelings ever.

# Review PRs

<img alt="" class="rounded-md h-sm mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-review.png" />

<!--
Aside from making PRs, you can also review them!

Reviews can come from anyone – it doesn't have to be the Django Fellows. It's not only Natalia and Sarah who can do reviews – you can too. The fellows will take care of the merging later.

You don't have to know the entire Django codebase to review PRs. With how big Django is, I don't think anyone does. But if you use Django enough, you'll be familiar with where things go.

And remember – these PRs will eventually become the things you use as a Django user. Reviewing PRs from the perspective of a user really helps shape the APIs to be as friendly as they can be. So go out there and start reviewing.

# Create and triage tickets

<img alt="" class="rounded-md h-sm mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-trac.png" />

<!--
And if you use Django enough, you'll encounter moments where you wish Django can do better. Maybe you find a bug, a potential feature, or a paragraph in the documentation you wish were there.

Write a ticket. Explain the situation and how you think it can be improved. Maybe others feel the same way, or maybe nobody had thought about it. Then maybe someone else works on it and get a PR merged into Django, giving you what you want – without you writing a single line of code.

Or maybe it gets rejected – but it's okay, we have disagreements from time to time. You can bring it up on the forums and maybe we change our minds. Here's a fun fact: the ticket for JSONField in Django was initially rejected. So, if your idea gets rejected, do not be discouraged.

# Maintain packages

<img alt="" class="rounded-md w-lg mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-packages.png" />

<!--
Maintain packages.

Django has batteries included, but the superchargers are sold separately. For a good reason.

The JSONField we now have in core wouldn't be possible without the existing packages we had in the ecosystem.

So if you're a Django package maintainer, I thank you.

# Test against Django's main

<img alt="" class="rounded-md w-3xl mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-cimain.png" />

<!--
Okay, this is an easy one.

If you haven't already, add an extra setup in your CI matrix to test your project against Django's `main` branch. Whether your project is a Django package, or an actual Django project. Test against Django's main.

This helps catch bugs and compatibility issues early. And it applies to both sides. You can anticipate any API changes much quicker.

If all is well, you're going to be more confident in upgrading to the final release when it comes out.

In some rare cases, it might turn out to be a regression in Django. Which is actually great, because if you report that and it gets fixed, you'll save other people from having the same trouble.

We do this with Wagtail, and there have been a few times where we noticed some regressions and we reported and/or submitted the fix. Everyone wins.

# Donate

<!--
If you've got some extra money but not the time to do any of the previous stuff, here's an easy one.

Maintaining Django costs money. The DSF pays out the Django Fellows, and that money comes from donations. So, make a donation.

# Participate in events

<img alt="" class="rounded-md h-sm mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-events.png" />

<!--
And participate in events, just like this!

And if you want to take it a step further, you can help organize the events.

There's plenty of opportunities to volunteer, so if you're interested, just ask the organizers.

And when you return home from DjangoCon this week, check out your local Django meetups. In the UK, we have a Django meetup in London, and there are also the DjangoSocial groups in other places, including here in Durham.

And finally...

# Use it!

<img alt="" class="rounded-md w-4xl mx-auto mb-4" src="/django-use.png" />

<!--
Just use it. Use Django.

This is a screenshot of Django's usage statistics on GitHub.

I don't know what happened here when I took it, but this was not edited. I think there must've been a bug on GitHub because that's a _lot_ of cats.

Unless, maybe, some of us are cats. Do we have any cats in the room?

Anyway. One of the reasons why my uni teaches Django is because it's widely used in the industry. If nobody used Django – I wouldn't be here today.

So, use Django. And that's it from me.
